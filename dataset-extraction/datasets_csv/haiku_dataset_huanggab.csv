huanggab,Birds begin to chirp,Nameless hills shrouded in mist,Early spring morning
huanggab,I enjoy comfort,Just not if it prevents me,From chasing my dreams
huanggab,Is there really hope?,"It sleeps, then shows up, repeat",The urge in my heart.
huanggab,When our journey ends,We will follow the path home,Clear skies are ahead

huanggab,"Humid, warm weather",blue sky over black coffee,summer spent with you
huanggab,gazing deeper still,I must know what lies within,oh it's only lint
huanggab,Do you feel alone,I feel alone without you,Lets walk together
huanggab,Panic starts to show,In the mans humble body,Calm! He accepts fate.
huanggab,Soft gray rabbit fur,Caught beneath cedar branches,We both jump backwards
huanggab,rain falls like angels,with broken wings and sad hearts,jumping from heaven
huanggab,The touch of your hand,"Would be salvation for me,","Now, but not for us."
huanggab,My heart in your hand,Exploring so recklessly,will we be friends again
huanggab,Flickering Candle,We both know what will happen,A sigh of relief
huanggab,sharing cold pizza,in the daffodils barefoot,listening to jazz 🍕

huanggab,bridge to tar island,cigarette stumps interspersed,with pink rose petals
huanggab,"We’re cursed, you and I",We strayed so far from Eden,No turning back now
huanggab,At life’s feeble end,What is your final instinct,A sigh or a gasp?
huanggab,rattled old visions,from the thin side of panic,wet eyes in the dark
huanggab,Warm months waning soon,Traveling to see old friends,"Here and now, happy"
huanggab,My favorite things;,Facing demons in the dark,And becoming light

huanggab,I'm walking back home,Familiar paths guide me,But nothing's the same
huanggab,Thick putrid bile,thirsty customers flock,close to emptiness
huanggab,Though an ocean gapes,endless love waits patiently,for a promise kept
huanggab,miming a Jedi,the supermarket doors,stay closed
huanggab,the whoosh of the breeze,follows me down the pathway,we walk together

huanggab,My back is so sore,Computer chair bends me out,of the human shape
huanggab,Tron the program died,"Old unsold, electron grave",Why do programs die?
huanggab,Beneath starry skies,"open eyes, here I lie; this",is my slice of pie.
huanggab,My penis got caught,In my pantaloons zipper,Made me think of you
huanggab,Up on the mountain,There's a fire inside,My soul burnt to ash
huanggab,Learn more useful skills,and consume less media,then you'll be prepared
huanggab,I buy the petrol,the wheels go round and around,I have no money left
huanggab,Oh Em Gee A Tree,Old ones are super scary,denderphobia
huanggab,boy drives home empty,thinking how to talk badly,She talks to others
huanggab,"Now Unemployed,",Masturbation fills the void.,My hand is sticky.
