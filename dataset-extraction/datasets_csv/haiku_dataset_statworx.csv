bfbarry,Mellow rimmed with salt.,People bustle all around.,Waves against my shore.
bfbarry,That place is outside.,We huddled under a quilt.,Disaster it and kiss.
bfbarry,I still remember.,How we kissed passionately?,But where are you now?
bfbarry,Like a calm haiku.,Focus is my mind flowing.,I have work to do.
bfbarry,The false friend stalks you.,The snake constantly deceives.,Crush them underfoot.
bfbarry,"No sprinkles, just plain.",Last doughnut in the break room.,"Monday morning, Blues."
bfbarry,She counted her worth.,Not by those she helped or loved.,But pounds and measures.
bfbarry,Thanksgiving dinner.,Please don't bring up politics.,"Warm, mashed potatoes."
bfbarry,Shadows run between.,Autumn sun sets lower now.,The forest lays dark.
bfbarry,Cold dew this morning.,Tea and conversation helps.,"Off to work, he goes."
bfbarry,There are memories.,They only live on in me.,All of you have gone.
bfbarry,Should I delete it?,Nobody's upvoting it.,My daily haiku.
bfbarry,How to get the most?,Upvotes for writing haiku.,Maybe Google knows.
bfbarry,So those of you that?,Exercise at home daily.,What is your secret?
bfbarry,Neither here nor there.,Continually searching thin air.,It flows around me.
bfbarry,"Hello, reddittors.","I'm new to Haiku, so please.",Give me some advice.
bfbarry,Final reflection.,A life which has not blossomed.,A premature end.
bfbarry,A stack of breakfast.,"Pour some syrup on there, too.",Let's get some pancakes.
bfbarry,I wish in my youth.,I were told all life's secrets.,But would I listen?
bfbarry,To take your own life.,Never knowing your own life.,Is a life unlived?
bfbarry,"Why this way, my Lord?",Why can I not understand?,I choose to trust you.
bfbarry,Your wife was murdered.,Why treat me like a suspect?,You're draped in her will.
bfbarry,Lawnmower growling.,Bright sun cresting cloudless sky.,Cityscape baking.
bfbarry,Ease between sheets.,Rain drumming on the tin roof.,Nature's Lullaby.
bfbarry,"Coyote, Sunset.",Sky goes from purple to pink.,Mesa silhouettes.
bfbarry,Seagulls are soaring.,Unseen currents overhead.,Cries of freedom found.
bfbarry,There is a silence.,Stillness underneath the noise.,Aware of itself.
bfbarry,Wonder if I've met?,Something special in your texts.,Love in infancy.
bfbarry,The alarms sound off.,I sleep with one eye open.,How did you get in?
bfbarry,'Sale in the dark.,Trying to solve my problems.,Maybe I'll just smile.
bfbarry,I'm felling depressed.,Wish I could hug someone now.,I miss all my friends.
bfbarry,A breath of jasmine.,Remembers the rain just past?,And sunshine to come.
bfbarry,Of all things that kill.,You choose self deprecation.,I like you for you.
bfbarry,At the break of dawn.,A content spider takes rest.,In flower petals.
bfbarry,Terrence McKenna.,Your words have opened my eyes.,And therefore my eye.
bfbarry,Call me your savior.,I will breathe life into you.,You will swim again.
bfbarry,I have decided.,To be a haiku writer.,I'm not very good.
bfbarry,"OK, I replied.",Receiving the lie you told.,"I love you too, babe."
bfbarry,A's m r eh.,Tingle and mingle my brain.,Better than cocaine.
bfbarry,From what great away?,Has this rain drop come today?,To land on my cheek.
bfbarry,Gray skies in the east.,Watching them is not enough.,I have things to do.
bfbarry,Eyes are on the prize.,Focus is unrelenting.,Today is the day.
bfbarry,A chance to explain.,My poorly guessed intentions.,Missing.
bfbarry,I had my own life.,Until you showed up in it.,Now I want to share.
bfbarry,Hidden day owls hoot.,An old man told me of you.,Unexpected joy.
bfbarry,I like how you taste.,I'm going to savour this.,Until I regret.
bfbarry,My life is haiku.,"Just five, seven and five things.",And it is Haiku.
bfbarry,Skyes paved in concrete.,"While tail lights paint, the snow red.","Geese, take the fast lane."
bfbarry,Literally took.,The words right out of my mouth.,"Give them back, you thief."
bfbarry,Sit along edges.,Pressed against my bed's corners.,A pure restlessness.
bfbarry,Too bad I cannot.,Post pictures to truly show.,Meaning beyond words.
bfbarry,You asked to help me?,I refusedsoon I was lost.,Will I ever learn?
bfbarry,Ants on the table.,Dirty laundry on the floor.,I need to clean up.
bfbarry,I don't even know.,Why I keep playing this game?,I lost long ago.
bfbarry,The extent of breath.,Energy flows throughout me.,The balance restored.
bfbarry,A dark night closes.,And as I open my eyes.,Bugs sing good morning.
bfbarry,A beautiful day.,Shivering despite the sun.,Cold as loneliness.
bfbarry,My plate'always full.,Called to love and servealways.,I do it for you.
bfbarry,I should be working.,On my homework due tonight.,But I'd rather not.
bfbarry,Singing songs of love.,I sit by the river bank.,Waiting for a boat?
bfbarry,Night turns to morning.,Reason and logic long gone.,Damn this lizard brain.
bfbarry,Rain on the windows.,Takeout chopsticks and the couch.,Late night paradise.
bfbarry,A chorus of frogs.,Are peeping out spring notes in?,A soprano bog.
bfbarry,Ageing is funny.,We find new ways to fuck up.,As we go along.
bfbarry,The bed depresses.,Is it the mattress or me?,"Either way, I sink."
bfbarry,It went the wrong way.,The water chose for my lungs.,I started coughing.
bfbarry,It's like a nicked vein.,Blooding unable to stop.,Iron mixed with salt.
bfbarry,There are only six.,You heard me six taco bells?,In all of Japan.
bfbarry,Sun on my shoulders.,A walk with mother nature.,Fresh air clears the mind.
bfbarry,A disconnection.,A block of time that is gone.,Will I ever know?
bfbarry,Your words like daggers.,Wielded with such precision.,Invisible wounds.
bfbarry,"Blooding though, uncut.",Internal wounds never healed.,Now I love the pain.
bfbarry,When I walk with you.,I want to fall into you.,And touch all of you.
bfbarry,Humorous spring unfolds.,The fair little tree hangs on.,Tiny mountain walls.
bfbarry,Art confined to dust.,No capacity for change.,Death of the Haiku.
bfbarry,Anthony Bourdain.,Ultimately lost the fight.,What chance do I have?
bfbarry,I should feel fainter.,Surely I've lost enough blood.,This hole in my heart.
bfbarry,Tell me your burden.,I will toss mine to the ground.,To help carry yours.
bfbarry,"Small blue bits, gray clouds.","Long lost dreams gone, sand grains fall.",Three more shots today.
bfbarry,Just two waves joining.,"[Climating] Chaos, ocean.",Then peaceful once more.
bfbarry,Secluded alone.,Humanities meaning lost.,I have become death.
bfbarry,We turn from the sun.,And the trees withdraw their sap.,Small lives are ending.
bfbarry,"Open, honest, fresh.",Love filled each moment with you.,Again is my hope.
bfbarry,"Poor effort, you say.",The rules don't apply to me.,The Haiku rebel.
bfbarry,Northeast and northwest.,"Never shall they meet, they say.",We defied the rules.
bfbarry,I smoke weed daily.,"Puff puff pass, it is so dank.","Oh, shit, my pipe broke."
bfbarry,No wind for the sail.,All the world yet to be had.,Birds have all the luck.
bfbarry,The daily drive home.,A scenic and gorgeous view.,Puffy valleys and hills.
bfbarry,But you'd be surprised.,The epiphanies you'd find.,In another's life.
bfbarry,I'm just waiting here.,You promised me forever.,Now I am alone.
bfbarry,If the good die young.,Then why am I still alive?,Is it'cause I'm bad?
bfbarry,Here is a haiku.,That I wrote this afternoon.,About a haiku.
bfbarry,No clear path ahead.,Take control with quarantine.,Ensure your wellbeing.
bfbarry,Gilding a goldfinch.,Perched within a budding tree.,He unties her scarf.
bfbarry,I wish I cared less.,I wish that I could forget.,Erase my sadness.
bfbarry,Somewhere over the.,Rainbow way up high there's A.,Land that I heard of.
